# SACFA-Details
SACFA details from WPC website

Excel macro file in this repository gets SACFA details for SACFA applied sites directly from the WPC website 
by just feeding the SACFA Idâ€™s. It saves a lot of time, gets the latest status of the SACFA application and 
eliminates our dependency on vendors to get updated SACFA status.
